### Java and Kotlin

#### OOP

* **Explain OOP Concepts.**
    - Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology of designing a program using classes, objects, 
    [inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)),
    [polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)),
    [abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(software_engineering)), and
    [encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)).

* **What is the difference between a constructor and a method?** 
    - The name of the constructor is same as that of the class name, whereas the name of the method can be anything.
    - There is no return type of a constructor.
    - When you make an object of a class, then the constructor of that class will be called automatically. But for methods, we need to call it explicitely.
    - Constructors can't be inherited but you can call the constructor of the parent class by calling `super()`.

* **Differences between abstract classes and interfaces?** 
    - An abstract class, is a class that contains both concrete and abstract methods 
    (methods without implementations). An abstract method must be implemented by the abstract class
     sub-classes. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated and need to be extended to be used.
    - An interface is like a blueprint/contract of a class (or it may be thought of as a class with methods, but without their implementation). It contains empty methods that 
    represent, what all of its subclasses should have in common. The subclasses provide the 
    implementation for each of these methods. Interfaces are implemented.

* **What is the difference between iterator and enumeration in java?**
    - In Enumeration we have remove() method and we can only read and traverse through a collection.
    - Iterators can be applied to any collection. In Iterator, we can read and remove items from a collection.

* **Do you agree we use composition over inheritance?** [Learn from here](https://www.journaldev.com/12086/composition-vs-inheritance)

* **Difference between method overloading and overriding.**
        <p align="center">
        <img alt="Overloading and Overriding" src="https://github.com/codeshef/android-interview-questions/blob/master/assets/overloading-vs-overriding.png">
        </p>
    - Overloading happens at compile-time while Overriding happens at runtime: The binding of overloaded method call to its definition happens at compile-time however binding of overridden method call to its definition happens at runtime.
    More info on static vs. dynamic binding: [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19017258/static-vs-dynamic-binding-in-java).
    - Static methods can be overloaded which means a class can have more than one static method of same name. Static methods cannot be overridden, even if you declare a same static method in child class it has nothing to do with the same method of parent class as overridden static methods are chosen by the reference class and not by the class of the object.

        So, for example:
        ```java
        public class Animal {
            public static void testClassMethod() {
                System.out.println("The static method in Animal");
            }

            public void testInstanceMethod() {
                System.out.println("The instance method in Animal");
            }
        }

        public class Cat extends Animal {
            public static void testClassMethod() {
                System.out.println("The static method in Cat");
            }

            public void testInstanceMethod() {
                System.out.println("The instance method in Cat");
            }

            public static void main(String[] args) {
                Cat myCat = new Cat();
                myCat.testClassMethod();
                Animal myAnimal = myCat;
                myAnimal.testClassMethod();
                myAnimal.testInstanceMethod();
            }
        }
        ```
        Will output:
        ```java
        The static method in Cat    // testClassMethod() is called from "Cat" reference

        The static method in Animal // testClassMethod() is called from "Animal" reference,
                                    // ignoring actual object inside it (Cat)

        The instance method in Cat  // testInstanceMethod() is called from "Animal" reference,
                                    // but from "Cat" object underneath
        ```

        The most basic difference is that overloading is being done in the same class while for overriding base and child classes are required. Overriding is all about giving a specific implementation to the inherited method of parent class.

        Static binding is being used for overloaded methods and dynamic binding is being used for overridden/overriding methods.
        Performance: Overloading gives better performance compared to overriding. The reason is that the binding of overridden methods is being done at runtime.

        Private and final methods can be overloaded but they cannot be overridden. It means a class can have more than one private/final methods of same name but a child class cannot override the private/final methods of their base class.

        Return type of method does not matter in case of method overloading, it can be same or different. However in case of method overriding the overriding method can have more specific return type (meaning if, for example, base method returns an instance of Number class, all overriding methods can return any class that is extended from Number, but not a class that is higher in the hierarchy, like, for example, Object is in this particular case).

        Argument list should be different while doing method overloading. Argument list should be same in method Overriding.
        It is also a good practice to annotate overridden methods with `@Override` to make the compiler be able to notify you if child is, indeed, overriding parent's class method during compile-time.

* **What are the access modifiers you know? What does each one do?** <br>
   - There are four access modifiers in Java language (from strictest to the most lenient):
        1. `private` *variables*, *methods*, *constructors* or *inner classes* are only visible to its' containing class and its' methods. This modifier is most commonly used, for example, to allow variable access only through getters and setters or to hide underlying implementation of classes that should not be used by user and therefore maintain encapsulation. Singleton constructor is also marked `private` to avoid unwanted instantiation from outside.
        2. `Default` (no keyword is used) this modifier can be applied to *classes*, *variables*, *constructors* and *methods* and allows access from classes and methods inside the same package.
        3. `protected` can be used on *variables*, *methods* and *constructors* therefore allowing access only to subclasses and classes that are inside the same package as protected members' class.
        4. `public` modifier is widely-used on *classes*, *variables*, *constructors* and *methods* to grant access from any class and method anywhere. It should not be used everywhere as it implies that data marked with `public` is not sensitive and can not be used to harm the program.

* **Can an Interface implement another Interface?**
  - Yes, an interface can implement another interface (and more than one), but it needs to use `extends`, rather than `implements` keyword. And while you can not remove methods from parent interface, you can add new ones freely to your sub-interface.

* **What is Polymorphism? What about Inheritance?**
  - Polymorphism in Java has two types: Compile time polymorphism (static binding) and Runtime polymorphism (dynamic binding). Method overloading is an example of static polymorphism, while method overriding is an example of dynamic polymorphism.

    An important example of polymorphism is how a parent class refers to a child class object.  In fact, any object that satisfies more than one IS-A relationship is polymorphic in nature.

    For instance, let’s consider a class `Animal` and let `Cat` be a subclass of `Animal`. So, any cat IS animal. Here, Cat satisfies the IS-A relationship for its own type as well as its super class Animal.
  - Inheritance can be defined as the process where one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another. With the use of inheritance the information is made manageable in a hierarchical order.

    The class which inherits the properties of other is known as subclass (derived class, child class) and the class whose properties are inherited is known as superclass (base class, parent class).

    Inheritance uses the keyword `extends` to inherit the properties of a class. Following is the syntax of extends keyword.
    ```java
    class Super {
       .....
       .....
    }
    class Sub extends Super {
       .....
       .....
    }
    ```

* **Stack Vs Queue** - [Learn from here](https://afteracademy.com/tech-interview/ds-algo-concepts/stack-and-queue)

* **Explain Generics in Java?**
    - Generics were included in Java language to provide stronger type checks, by allowing the programmer to define, which classes can be used with other classes
        > In a nutshell, generics enable types (classes and interfaces) to be parameters when defining classes, interfaces and methods. Much like the more familiar formal parameters used in method declarations, type parameters provide a way for you to re-use the same code with different inputs. The difference is that the inputs to formal parameters are values, while the inputs to type parameters are types. ([Official Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/why.html))

    - This means that, for example, you can define:
        ```java
        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
        ```
        And let the compiler take care of noticing, if you put some object, of type other than `Integer` into this list and warn you.
    - It should be noted that standard class hierarchy *does not* apply to generic types. It means that `Integer` in `List<Integer>` is not inherited from `<Number>` - it is actually inherited directly from `<Object>`. You can still put some constraints on what classes can be passed as a parameter into a generic by using [wildcards](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/extra/generics/wildcards.html) like `<?>`, `<? extends MyCustomClass>` or `<? super Number>`.
    - While generics are very useful, late inclusion into Java language has put some restraints on their implementation - backward compatibility required them to remain just "syntactic sugar" - they are erased ([type erasure](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/erasure.html)) during compile-time and replaced with `object` class.

* **What is Java PriorityQueue?**
        - In Priority Queue, each element is having some priority and all the elements are present in a queue. The operations are performed based on the priority.

#### Objects and Primitives

* **How is `String` class implemented? Why was it made immutable?**
  - There is no primitive variant of `String` class in Java language - all strings are just wrappers around underlying array of characters, which is declared `final`. This means that, once a `String` object is instantiated, it cannot be changed through normal tools of the language (Reflection still can mess things up horribly, because in Java no object is truly immutable). This is why `String` variables in classes are the first candidates to be used, when you want to override `hashCode()` and `equals()` of your class - you can be sure, that all their required contracts will be satisfied.
    > Note: The String class is immutable, so that once it is created a String object cannot be changed. The String class  has a number of methods, some of which will be discussed below, that appear to modify strings. Since strings are  immutable, what these methods really do is create and return a new string that contains the result of the operation. ([Official Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/strings.html))

    This class is also unique in a sense, that, when you create an instance like this:
    ```java
    String helloWorld = "Hello, World!";
    ```
    `"Hello, World!"` is called a *literal* and compiler creates a `String` object with its' value. So
    ```java
    String capital = "Hello, World!".toUpperCase();
    ```
    is a valid statement, that, firstly, will create an object with literal value "Hello, World!" and then will create and return another object with value "HELLO, WORLD!"
  - `String` was made immutable to prevent malicious manipulation of data, when, for example, user login or other sensitive data is being send to a server.

* **What does it means to say that a `String` is immutable?**
    - It means that once created, `String` object's `char[]` (its' containing value) is declared `final` and, therefore, it can not be changed during runtime.

* **What is `String.intern()`? When and why should it be used?**
    - `String.intern()` is used to mange memory in Java code. It is used when we have duplicates value in different strings. When you call the `String.intern()`, then if in the String pool that string is present then the `equals()` method will return true and it will return that string only.

* **Can you list 8 primitive types in java?**
    - `byte`
    - `short`
    - `int`
    - `long`
    - `float`
    - `double`
    - `char`
    - `String`
    - `boolean`

* **What is the difference between an Integer and int?**
  - `int` is a primitive data type (with `boolean`, `byte`, `char`, `short`, `long`, `float` and `double`), while `Integer` (with `Boolean`, `Byte`, `Character`, `Short`,`Long`, `Float` and `Double`) is a [wrapper](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/numberclasses.html) class that encapsulates primitive data type, while providing useful methods to perform different tasks with it.

* **What is Autoboxing and Unboxing?**
  - Autoboxing and Unboxing is the process of automatic wrapping (putting in a box) and unwrapping (getting the value out) of primitive data types, that have "wrapper" classes. So `int` and `Integer` can (almost always) be used interchangeably in Java language, meaning a method `void giveMeInt(int i) { ... }` can take `int` as well as `Integer` as a parameter.

* **Typecast in Java**
    - In Java, you can use casts to polymorph one class into another, compatible one. For example:
        ```java
            long i = 10l;
            int j = (int) i;
            long k = j;
        ```
        Here we see, that, while narrowing (`long i` -> `int j`) requires an explicit cast to make sure the programmer realizes, that there may be some data or precision loss, widening (`int j` -> `long k`) does not require an explicit cast, because there can be no data loss (`long` can take larger numbers than `int` allows).

* **Do objects get passed by reference or value in Java? Elaborate on that.**
    - In Java all primitives and objects are passed by value, meaning that their copy will be manipulated in the receiving method. But there is a caveat - when you pass an object reference into a method, a *copy of this reference* is made, so it still points to the same object. This means, that any changes that you make to the insides of this object are retained, when the method exits.
        ```java
        public class Pointer {

            int innerField;

            public Pointer(int a) {
                this.innerField = a;
            }
        }
        ```
        ```java
        public class ValueAndReference {

            public static void main(String[] args) {

                Pointer a = new Pointer(0);
                int b = 1;

                print("Before:");
                print("b = " + b);
                print("a.innerField = " + a.innerField);
                exampleMethod(a, b);
                print("After:");
                print("b = " + b);
                print("a.innerField = " + a.innerField);
            }

            static void exampleMethod(Pointer a, int b) {
                a.innerField = 2;
                b = 10;
            }

            static void print(String text) {
                System.out.println(text);
            }
        }
        ```
        Will output:
        ```java
            Before:

            b = 1

            a.innerField = 0

            After:

            b = 1        // a new local int variable was created and operated on, so "b" didn't change

            a.innerField = 2 // Pointer a got its' innerField variable changed
                             //  from 0 to 2, because method was operating on
                             //  the same reference to an instance
        ```

* **What the difference between local, instance and class variables?**
  - Local variables exist only in methods that created them, they are stored separately in their respected Thread Stack (for more information, see question about Java Memory Model) and cannot have their reference passed outside of the method scope. That also means that they cannot be assigned any access modifier or made `static` - because they only exist during enclosing method's execution and those modifiers just do not make sense, since no other outside method can get them anyway.
  - Instance variables are the ones, that are declared in classes and their value can be different from one instance of the class to another, but they always require that class' instance to exist.
  - Class variables are those, that are marked with `static` keyword in their class' body. They can only have one value across all instances of that class (changing it in one place will change it in their class and, therefore, in all instances) and can even be retrieved without that class' instance (if their access modifier allows it).

#### Java Memory Model and Garbage Collector

* **What is garbage collector? How does it work?**
  - All objects are allocated on the heap area managed by the JVM.
  As long as an object is being referenced, the JVM considers it alive.
  Once an object is no longer referenced and therefore is not reachable by the application code,
  the garbage collector removes it and reclaims the unused memory.

* **What is serialization? How do you implement it?**
    - Serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes in order to store
    an object into memory, so that it can be recreated at a later time, while still keeping the
    object's original state and data. In Android you may use either the Serializable, Externalizable (implements Serializable) or Parcelable interfaces.
    - While Serializable is the easiest to implement, Externalizable may be used if you need to insert custom logic into the process of serialization (although it is almost never used nowadays as it is considered a relic from early versions of Java). But it is highly recommended to use Parcelable in Android instead, as Parcelable was created exclusively for Android and it performs about 10x faster than Serializable, because Serializable uses reflection, which is a slow process and tends to create a lot of temporary objects and it may cause garbage collection to occur more often.
    - To use Serializable all you have to do is implement the interface:

        ```java
        /**
        *  Implementing the Serializable interface is all that is required
        */
        public class User implements Serializable {

            private String name;
            private String email;

                public User() {
                }

                public String getName() {
                    return name;
                }

                public void setName(final String name) {
                    this.name = name;
                }

                public String getEmail() {
                    return email;
                }

                public void setEmail(final String email) {
                    this.email = email;
                }
            }
        ```
    - Parcelable requires a bit more work:
        ```java
            public class User implements Parcelable {

                private String name;
                private String email;

                /**
                 * Interface that must be implemented and provided as a public CREATOR field
                 * that generates instances of your Parcelable class from a Parcel.
                 */
                public static final Creator<User> CREATOR = new Creator<User>() {

                    /**
                     * Creates a new USer object from the Parcel. This is the reason why
                     * the constructor that takes a Parcel is needed.
                     */
                    @Override
                    public User createFromParcel(Parcel in) {
                        return new User(in);
                    }

                    /**
                     * Create a new array of the Parcelable class.
                     * @return an array of the Parcelable class,
                     * with every entry initialized to null.
                     */
                    @Override
                    public User[] newArray(int size) {
                        return new User[size];
                    }
                };

                public User() {
                }

                /**
                 * Parcel overloaded constructor required for
                 * Parcelable implementation used in the CREATOR
                 */
                private User(Parcel in) {
                    name = in.readString();
                    email = in.readString();
                }

                public String getName() {
                    return name;
                }

                public void setName(final String name) {
                    this.name = name;
                }

                public String getEmail() {
                    return email;
                }

                public void setEmail(final String email) {
                    this.email = email;
                }

                @Override
                public int describeContents() {
                    return 0;
                }

                /**
                 * This is where the parcel is performed.
                 */
                @Override
                public void writeToParcel(final Parcel parcel, final int i) {
                    parcel.writeString(name);

* **When would you make an object value `final`?**

* **What are these `final`, `finally` and `finalize` keywords?**
  - `final` is a keyword in the java language. It is used to apply restrictions on class, method and variable. Final class can't be inherited, final method can't be overridden and final variable value can't be changed.
    ```java
    class FinalExample {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            final int x=100;
            x=200;//Compile Time Error because x is final
        }
    }
    ```
  - `finally` is a code block and is used to place important code, it will be executed whether exception is handled or not.
    ```java
    class FinallyExample {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            try {
                int x=300;
            }catch(Exception e) {
                System.out.println(e.getMessage());            }
            finally {
                System.out.println("finally block is executed");
            }
        }
    }
    ```
  - `Finalize` is a method used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected.
    ```java
    class FinalizeExample {
        public void finalize() {
            System.out.println("finalize called");
        }

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            FinalizeExample f1=new FinalizeExample();
            FinalizeExample f2=new FinalizeExample();
            f1=null;
            f2=null;
            System.gc();
        }
    }
    ```

* **What is the difference between "throw" and "throws" keyword in Java?**
    - `throws` is just used to indicated which exception is to be thrown. But the `throw` keyword is used to throw some exception from any static block or any method.

* **What does the `static` word mean in Java?**
    - In case of `static` variable it means that this variable (its' value or the object it references) spans across all instances of enclosing class (changing it in one instance affects all others), while in case of `static` methods it means that these methods can be invoked without an instance of their enclosing class. It is useful, for example, when you create util classes that need not be instantiated every time you want to use them.

* **Can a `static` method be overridden in Java?**
    - While child class can override a static method with another static method with the same signature (return type can be down-casted), it is not truly overridden - it becomes "hidden", but both methods can still be accessed under right circumstances (see question about overloading/overriding above).

* **When is a `static` block run?**
    - Code inside static block is executed only once: the first time you make an object of that class or the first time you access a static member of that class (even if you never make an object of that class).

* **What is reflection?**
    - You can inspect classes, interfaces, fields, and method at runtime with the help of reflection and the best part is that you need not know the names of these classes, methods, etc.

    - Fail-safe iterator will not throw any exception even if the collection is modified while iteration over it. But in Fail-safe iterator, it throws a ConcurrentModificationException when you try to modify the collection while using it.

* **Sorting Algorithms** - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm?oldformat=true)
    - Using the most efficient sorting algorithm (and correct data structures that implement it) is vital for any program, because data manipulation can be one of the most significant bottlenecks in case of performance and the main purpose of spending time, determining the best algorithm for the job, is to drastically improve said performance. The efficiency of an algorithm is measured in its' "Big O" ([StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/487258/what-is-a-plain-english-explanation-of-big-o-notation)) score. Really good algorithms perform important actions in O(n log n) or even O(log n) time and some of them can even perform certain actions in O(1) time (HashTable insertion, for example). But there is always a trade-off - if some algorithm is really good at adding a new element to a data structure, it is, most certainly, much worse at data access than some other algorithm. If you are proficient with math, you may notice that "Big O" notation has many similarities with "limits", and you would be right - it measures best, worst and average performances of an algorithm in question, by looking at its' function limit. It should be noted that, when we are speaking about O(1) - constant time - we are not saying that this algorithm performs an action in one operation, rather that it can perform this action with the same number of operations (roughly), regrardless of the amount of elements it has to take into account. Thankfully, a lot of "Big O" scores have been already calculated, so you don't have to guess, which algorithm or data structure will perform better in your project. ["Big O" cheat sheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)
    - Bubble sort [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort?oldformat=true) 
        - Bubble sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms. It just compares neighbouring elements and if the one that precedes the other is smaller - it changes their places. So over one iteration over the data list, it is guaranteed that **at least** one element will be in its' correct place (the biggest/smallest one - depending on the direction of sorting). This is not a very efficient algorithm, as highly unordered arrays will require a lot of reordering (upto O(n^2)), but one of the advantages of this algorithm is its' space complexity - only two elements are compared at once and there is no need to allocate more memory, than those two will occupy.

                    <th colspan="3" align="center">Time Complexity</th>

    - Selection sort [Wikipedia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Selection_sort) 
        - Firstly, selection sort assumes that the first element of the array to be sorted is the smallest, but to confirm this, it iterates over all other elements to check, and if it finds one, it gets defined as the smallest one. When the data ends, the element, that is currently found to be the smallest, is put in the beginning of the array. This sorting algorithm is quite straightforward, but still not that efficient on larger data sets, because to assign just one element to its' place, it needs to go over all data.

                <tr>
                    <th colspan="3" align="center">Time Complexity</th>

                    <th align="center">Average</th>
                    <th align="center">Worst</th>

                    <td align="center">Θ(n^2)</td>
                    <td align="center">O(n^2)</td>
                    <td align="center">O(1)</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
    - Insertion sort [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort?oldformat=true)
        - Insertion sort is another example of an algorithm, that is not that difficult to implement, but is also not that efficient. To do its' job, it "grows" sorted portion of data, by "inserting" new encountered elements into already (innerly) sorted part of the array, which consists of previously encountered elements. This means that in best case (data is already sorted) it can confirm that its' job is done in Ω(n) operations, while, if all encountered elements are not in their required order as many as O(n^2) operations may be needed.

                <th colspan="3" align="center">Time Complexity</th>

    - Merge sort [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort?oldformat=true)
        - This is a "divide and conquer" algorithm, meaning it recursively "divides" given array in to smaller parts (up to 1 element) and then sorts those parts, combining them with each other. This approach allows merge sort to achieve very high speed, while  doubling required space, of course, but today memory space is more available than it was a couple of years ago, so this trade-off is considered acceptable.

    - Quicksort [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort?oldformat=true)
        - Quicksort is considered, well, quite quick. When implemented correctly, it can be a significant number of times faster than its' main competitors. This algorithm is also of "divide and conquer" family and its' first step is to choose a "pivot" element (choosing it randomly, statistically, minimizes the chance to get the worst performance), then by comparing elements to this pivot, moving it closer and closer to its' final place. During this process, the elements that are bigger are moved to the right side of it and smaller elements to the left. After this is done, quicksort repeats this process for subarrays on each side of placed pivot (does first step recursively), until the array is sorted.
